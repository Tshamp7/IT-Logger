Hello!
Welcome to my IT logger App.
This is a simple react app utilizing context API and redux to manage tickets submitted for an imaginary IT help desk.
This allows CRUD operations for tickets, as well as adding and delting technicians.

to get started simply:

run "npm install" to install dependencies

then, run "npm run dev" which will run the frontend and backend applications on ports 3000 and 5000 respectively.
The applcation frontend interface can be viewed on localhost:3000.
